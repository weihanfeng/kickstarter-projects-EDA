# Kickstarter dataset Analysis

## Background

**Kickstarter** is a crowdfunding platform where backers could pledge fundings in order to bring a creative project to life. The genre of projects could range from film, music, games, food, or anything under the sun. Since its inception in 2009, it has gained widespread popularity and is now one of the largest crowdfunding platforms out there.

But what is a good kickstarter project? What kind of project will give you successful funding? The genre of the project? The funding goal? The level of engagement? The year? Month? Day of week? This project aims to provide insights to a successful kickstarter project by analysing a set of kickstarter projects from 2009 to 2012.

Keeping the backers engaged is important to getting more backers. Releasing regular updates helps to keep the potential backers engaged. Sometimes, just 1 update makes all the difference.
